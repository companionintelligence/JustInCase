## Exploitation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Memory Exhaustion Attack
**Attacker Action:** Send HTTP requests with unlimited body size  
**System Response:** Server allocates unbounded memory  
**Impact:** Application crash, DoS  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Remediation:** Implement request size limits (Critical #1)

### Scenario 2: Unauthorized Access
**Attacker Action:** Direct API calls to /query endpoint  
**System Response:** Process requests without authentication  
**Impact:** Resource abuse, data exfiltration  
**Likelihood:** High  
**Remediation:** Implement authentication (Critical #3)

### Scenario 3: File Disclosure
**Attacker Action:** URL-encoded path traversal (%2e%2e/)  
**System Response:** Read arbitrary files  
**Impact:** Sensitive file exposure  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Remediation:** Fix path validation (Critical #7)

### Scenario 4: Database Compromise
**Attacker Action:** Use default credentials to access database  
**System Response:** Full database access granted  
**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation  
**Likelihood:** Medium (if defaults not changed)  
**Remediation:** Remove hardcoded credentials (Critical #5)

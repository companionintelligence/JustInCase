## Hardware

Running a JIC server at home requires performant hardware. Hardware itself has its own issues:

1. Redundancy and backup format ... multiple copies, including non-magnetic or optical media make sense. SSDs are more robust but can degrade.

2. Ruggedness: If you’re building a “server in a box” to survive rough conditions, consider rugged/industrial hardware or a protected environment (pelican case, waterproof containers, shock mounting, etc.).

3. Low Power Consumption: If you expect to run off solar or battery, a low-power machine (like a Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computer) might be ideal. Then attach large external storage.

4. Battery Backup: For areas with uncertain power, incorporate an internal battery or external UPS system.

5. Local Network (LAN / Wi-Fi). You can configure a small Wi-Fi hotspot using a router or a Raspberry Pi in hotspot mode, so anyone with a device can connect and browse the offline library.

6. “Server on a Stick”. Another approach is to store the data on an external HDD or SSD with a simplified file structure that can be plugged into a laptop or PC. This requires less hardware setup but depends on each user’s computer to navigate the data.

7. Pre-Loaded Laptops/Tablets. Some might sell or distribute rugged laptops or tablets that already have the library installed. This is more expensive but is a complete kit.

## Existing efforts

Existing efforts include:

1. [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org) ... an offline reader for web based content with offline copies of wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, Wikihow, videos on emergency and military medicine, information about common drugs, prepper package for "SHTF" needs.

2. [Internet-in-a-box](https://internet-in-a-box.org) ... a Raspberry PI centered system that creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot serving offline content. Loaded with Kiwix based content and additional educational materials.

3. [RACHEL](https://rachel.worldpossible.org) ... another offline content server and hotspot, designed for schools or remote learning. Features Khan Academy Lite, Wikipedia for Schools, Project Gutenberg, medical resources, educational software.

4. [Kolibri](https://learningequality.org/kolibri/about-kolibri/) ... an open-source learning platform focused on offline distribution of educational content (videos, exercises, e-books). Offers a structured / formal approach to delivering courses, lessons, and content packs, including Khan Academy videos organized by subject and grade level as well as interactive exercises.

5. [CD3WD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3WD) ... a large collection of public-domain or open-licensed PDFs, manuals, and guides for agriculture, water, construction, engineering, and basic healthcare—originally compiled for developing regions. Lots of practical documents on small-scale farming, well drilling, appropriate technology, etc. Some are older or outdated, but still very relevant for low-tech or off-grid scenarios. Perfect for a “rebuild civilization” library: includes practical “how-to” info you won’t easily find in mainstream survival guides.

6. [Appropriate Technology Library by Village Earth](https://villageearth.org/home/appropriate-technology-library) ... a huge compilation (tens of thousands of pages) of resources on low-cost, locally-sustainable solutions. Covers agriculture, food processing, renewable energy, water/sanitation, health, and more, often sourced from institutions like Peace Corps, FAO, WHO, etc. If you want to focus heavily on rebuilding with minimal tech or locally available resources, this set of documents is pure gold.

7. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) ... the oldest and best known digital library of public-domain books. While mostly classic literature, it also includes older reference works, historical texts, and some scientific/technical publications that have fallen into the public domain. Great if you want to add cultural/literary or historical texts to your offline library, all legally free to redistribute.

8. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) ... the canonical 'backup of the Internet'. You'll have to be selective but there are many scanned books, texts and videos including government provided PDFs on first aid, disaster response, agricultural services, WHO, CDC, Red Cross guides for medical and disease treatment. USDA agricultural handbooks. Academic Open Access resources. Libretex. OpenStax (Rice University free textbooks). In some cases some of these materials are not open source.

9. Other Niche Prepper Libraries ... You can find various “prepper PDF libraries” scattered across the Internet (on forums or specialized websites). They often include older US military field manuals, survival books, NBC (nuclear/biological/chemical) guides, homesteading, medical references, etc. Many such archives are compiled by individuals or small groups and shared via torrent or direct download. Just be mindful of licensing and the quality of materials (some are public domain, some are not). Often these are bundled with hardware solutions as well. See also:

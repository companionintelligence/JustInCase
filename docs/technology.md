Modern large-language-model systems rely on vector representations to bridge the gap between unstructured text and computational reasoning. At the foundation is a document store—a repository that holds source material such as reports, articles, and transcripts, broken into manageable chunks. Each chunk is converted into a dense vector, a high-dimensional numerical embedding that encodes the semantic meaning of the text. These vectors make it possible to compare passages not by keywords but by conceptual similarity, allowing the system to recall relevant context even when the phrasing differs entirely from the user’s query.

To generate these embeddings, open-source models such as Nomic-Embed, E5, or GTE are widely used. They are lightweight transformer encoders trained to map sentences into a shared semantic space where related ideas cluster together. Nomic’s model, in particular, is optimized for general retrieval across domains and languages, offering both quality and speed for local deployments. The resulting vectors are stored in a vector index—for example, FAISS, HNSWlib, or pgvector—that supports approximate nearest-neighbor search over millions of items with millisecond latency.

When a query arrives, the system encodes it into its own vector and searches the index for the closest matches. The top-ranked chunks are then optionally re-ranked using a more precise cross-encoder or a lightweight LLM to refine relevance. The highest-scoring passages are concatenated with the user’s question to form the prompt context passed to the model. This retrieval-augmented process effectively expands the model’s working memory beyond its fixed context window, allowing it to reason over large document collections while staying grounded in verifiable sources.

Finally, a carefully designed pre-prompt or system instruction establishes the model’s behavior—directing it to use retrieved material faithfully, cite evidence, or adopt a particular tone. Together, these elements—document storage, vector embeddings, fast similarity search, reranking, and prompt construction—form the backbone of modern retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that extend LLMs from generic text generators into targeted, knowledge-grounded assistants.
